             <p id="card-text" class="card-text">Apple could be putting an Action button on your next iPhone. According to a July
                    report from MacRumors, code in the fourth iOS 17 developer beta hints at functionality for an Action
                    button on the next-gen iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models.
                    Apple introduced the Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra. It's a physical button on the side of
                    the Apple Watch Ultra that allows you to run a preselected function or program when you press it
                    without unlocking your device or navigating to an app. Some of the preselected functions include
                    starting a stopwatch, beginning a workout and turning on your flashlight.</p>
