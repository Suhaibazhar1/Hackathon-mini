                <p class="card-text">Apple could be putting an Action button on your next iPhone. According to a July
                    report from MacRumors, code in the fourth iOS 17 developer beta hints at functionality for an Action
                    button on the next-gen iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models.
                    Apple introduced the Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra. It's a physical button on the side of
                    the Apple Watch Ultra that allows you to run a preselected function or program when you press it
                    without unlocking your device or navigating to an app. Some of the preselected functions include
                    starting a stopwatch, beginning a workout and turning on your flashlight.</p>

                    Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and
                    multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and diverse
                    dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover,
                    it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into
                    English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful
                    applications and for further research on robust speech processing.</p>

                    We have trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format
                    makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect
                    premises, and reject inappropriate requests.

                    premises, and reject inappropriate requests.Methods:
                    We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same
                    methods as InstructGPT, but with slight differences in the data collection setup. We trained an
                    initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they
                    played both sidesâ€”the user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written
                    suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the
                    InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue format.
                    To create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect comparison data, which
                    consisted of two or more model responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took
                    conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly selected a model-written message,
                    sampled several alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank them. Using these reward models,
                    we can fine-tune the model using Proximal Policy Optimization. We performed several iterations of
                    this process.
